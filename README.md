<h1>Ryans Inventory Analysis</h1>

<h2>Project Overview </h2>

Explore inventory management using sample sales data to gain valuable insights. Learn to analyze sales trends, stock levels, and demand patterns to optimize inventory. Segment and cluster data to identify high-performing products, seasonal demand, and customer purchasing behavior. Utilize data-driven strategies to reduce stockouts, minimize overstocking, and improve supply chain efficiency. Enhance decision-making by leveraging predictive analytics, sales forecasting, and inventory optimization techniques.

<h2>Key Findings </h2>

****Performance Index by Brand:**** Focus on increasing stock for fast-selling Liquid Retina models and reconsider bulk stocking of slow-moving QHD+, WUXGA, and LED displays.

****Stock by Processor Brand:**** Intel dominates the stock, while AMD and Apple have a smaller presence; increase stock if demand rises.

****Performance Index & Stock Quality:**** Apple and Gigabyte offer high-performance laptops, while low-performance models may need discounts or reduced orders.

****Market Share vs. Stock Levels:**** Lenovo, Asus, and Apple have the highest market share, so adjusting stock for underperforming models can optimize inventory.
